AI-Driven Audio Summaries for Books:
Enhancing Accessibility and Engagement
Introduction and Motivation
There are millions of books out there, and choosing the right one can often feel
overwhelming. For readers who want a quick way to decide if a book suits their taste,
traditional text summaries are useful but limited. They often fail to capture the essence,
tone, or style of a book, especially when it comes to specific genres like mystery, romance,
or sci-fi. This problem is even more significant for people with visual impairments or
reading difficulties, who rely on audio content for access. Current options don’t always
provide summaries tailored to individual preferences or deliver them in a way that reflects
the emotional nuances of a genre. To solve this, we’re developing an AI-driven system that
generates concise audio summaries of books. These summaries will match the tone and
style of the book’s genre, giving users a better sense of what the book feels like while
making the content more accessible.
Related Work
The idea of summarizing books and generating audio content isn’t new, but recent
advances in AI have opened new possibilities. Here’s a look at some existing methods and
tools:
1. Text Summarization: Models like BART and PEGASUS are widely used for creating
summaries that are not just cut-and-paste versions of the text but rephrased to
make them concise and easy to understand. These models have been used in news
aggregation and document summarization, with promising results.
2. Genre Classification: Traditional methods like support vector machines (SVMs) and
Naïve Bayes classifiers have been around for a while. More recently, transformers
like BERT and GPT have taken over, providing deeper understanding and better
results when fine-tuned for specific tasks like genre detection.
3. Voice Synthesis: Tools like Tacotron 2 and WaveNet have brought voice synthesis
closer to human quality. They’re not just about clear pronunciation but also about
capturing emotions and tone, making them ideal for creating engaging audio
summaries.
Our project builds on these advancements but adds a unique twist: tailoring both the
summaries and the audio tone to match the genre of the book. This means a suspenseful
thriller would sound tense and dramatic, while a romantic novel would feel warm and
emotional.
Dataset
Genre Classification Dataset
• Source: A dataset from Kaggle containing thousands of books categorized by genre.
• Details: This dataset includes text excerpts and metadata like title and author,
which will help train our genre classifier.
• Preparation: We’ll clean the text to remove irrelevant data, tokenize it, and prepare
it for feeding into the classification model.
Summary Dataset
• Source: Public datasets like those from Goodreads and Project Gutenberg, which
provide summaries alongside full texts of books.
• Details: These will be used to fine-tune the summarization model, ensuring it
generates concise and meaningful summaries.
Methodology
Step 1: Predicting the Genre
The first step is to determine the genre of the book:
• Model: We’re starting with a NN model to classify genres like fiction, mystery, and
sci-fi.
• Training: We’ll split the Kaggle dataset into training and validation sets. Early trials
with simple classifiers showed fairly good results.
Step 2: Generating the Summary
Once the genre is known, the system will summarize the book:
• Text Extraction: We’ll use reliable tools to extract text from the uploaded PDF.
• Summarization Model: PEGASUS, a leading abstractive summarization model, will
generate summaries tailored to the genre.
Step 3: Creating the Audio
Finally, we’ll turn the summary into audio:
• Voice Synthesis: Tacotron 2 will generate natural-sounding audio.
• Tone Modulation: The system will adjust the voice’s pitch, speed, and intonation to
match the emotional tone of the genre. For example, a mystery book might have a
slower, suspenseful narration, while a fantasy novel might have a more upbeat,
adventurous tone.
